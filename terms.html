<p><b>17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b></p>
<p><i>Binding Arbitration</i></p>
<p>The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for resolving any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the TOU or the Service, including, without limitation, any dispute with respect to this arbitration provision, any claim in tort, or any claim for violation of any federal, state or local statute, or ordinance or regulation (collectively, “Disputes”), shall be through confidential binding arbitration in Los Angeles County, California. The arbitration shall be conducted by JAMS/Endispute (“JAMS”), whose rules applicable to such disputes shall be in force, and judgment or the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. There shall be one arbitrator to be mutually selected by the parties, and if the parties cannot so select, the arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS. The fees of the arbitrator, administrative fees, and the other fees and costs of the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the cost of any record or transcripts of the arbitration, shall be advanced by the parties to the arbitration in equal portions, and, in addition thereto, each such party shall advance the fees of its own attorneys, the expenses of its witnesses and all other expenses connected with presenting its case. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ARBITRABLE CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM.</p>
<p><i>Waiver of Class Arbitration</i></p>
<p>To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all Disputes shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other Disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your Dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise (“Class Arbitration”). You further acknowledge and agree that any arbitrator assigned to a Dispute lacks the authority to conduct Class Arbitration and that such arbitrator shall only hear individual Disputes. By using the Site and the Service, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly waiving any right to participate as a representative or member of any class of claimants pertaining to any Dispute subject to arbitration under this TOU, such that you shall not be entitled to arbitrate any Dispute as a representative, a class action or in a private attorney general capacity.</p>

<p>These TOU constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and us. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. These TOU and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Unless otherwise provided herein, you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within the state of California. Any failure on our part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these TOU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these TOU remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
